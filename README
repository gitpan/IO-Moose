NAME
    IO::Moose - Reimplementation of IO::* with improvements

SYNOPSIS
      use IO::Moose 'Handle', 'File';  # loads IO::Moose::* modules

      $passwd = IO::Moose::File->new( file => '/etc/passwd' )->slurp;

DESCRIPTION
    `IO::Moose' provides a simple mechanism to load several modules in one
    go.

    `IO::Moose::*' classes provide an interface mostly compatible with IO.
    The differences:

    *   It is based on Moose object framework.

    *   It uses Exception::Base for signaling errors. Most of methods are
        throwing exception on failure.

    *   The modifiers like `input_record_separator' are supported on per
        file handler basis.

    *   It also implements additional methods like `say', `slurp'.
